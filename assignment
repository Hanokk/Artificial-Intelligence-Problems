1. Write a program to solve Traveling Salesman problem. The heuristic function used, number of nodes generated,
depth of the search at each stages should be given in the form of a table;

2. Write a program to solve 8 puzzle problem with different heuristics; 

3. Implement the alpha â€“ beta search procedures. Use it to play the game tic-tac-toe. At the
end of the game your program should give the number of nodes generated, cut-off values at each stages in the
form of a table; 

4. Write an ATN interpreter. Minimize the amount of information that must be stored at each node to allow back-up; 

5. Write an Eliza like program to converse in some domain. The program should consist of two parts,
a database of rules and the code that matches rules against the input and uses them to generate output. The left
side of each rule should be a pattern that can be matched against a sentence input by the user. The right side should
specify the response that the system will generate if the corresponding left side matches; 

6. Develop an knowledge base system consisting of facts and rules about some specialized knowledge domain of your choice; 

7. Implement Unification Algorithms. Input data sets may be any Well Formed Formulas; 

8. Write a program to schedule a meeting between five busy people using default reasoning. The output should give the time, place and day of the meeting.
